            <strong>ANSWERS:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>IP Adress is the internet adress, a unique string of numbers separated by full stops that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.</li>
                <li>A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website</li>
                <li>A uniform resource locator (URL) is the address of a resource on the Internet.</li>
                <li>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. .</li>
                <li>HTML is a Language while HTTP is a Protocol</li>
                <li>While the Internet is a global network comprised of computers, the World Wide Web is an extremely common application used online and it uses the hypertext transfer protocol, or http, to navigate across different websites.</li>
                <li>In simplest form, a server is a connection point for several clients, that will handle their requests</li>
                <li>Web page is a hypertext document connected to the World Wide Web.</li>
                <li>Getting a domain name involves registering the name you want with an organisation called ICANN through a domain name registrar</li>
                <li>I can host it on cloud hosting.</li>
                <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network.</li>
                <li>The browser is going to analyze the input. Usually if it has a ".com" it won't think you're typing search terms. And once it decides it must be a URL, it'll check that it has a scheme, if not, it'll add "http://" to the beginning.</li>
